To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/c++ -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/c++"

llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/ilaria/.bash_profile

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
==> numpy
To run `f2py`, you may need to `brew install python@3.12`
==> jupyterlab
Additional kernels can be installed into the shared jupyter directory
  /usr/local/etc/jupyter

Bash completion has been installed to:
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
